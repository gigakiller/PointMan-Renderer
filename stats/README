This folder contains some useful statistics that we use to evaluate PointMan.

1) histogram_one_over_z_error:
	a) Shows distribution of screen space errors for each OctreeNode
		starting from the default view. Used 40 bins, generated
		with hist(data, 40) in MATLAB. 
	b) Error metric is 1 / z, where z is the z-distance in SCREEN SPACE of the
		centroid of the octree node.
